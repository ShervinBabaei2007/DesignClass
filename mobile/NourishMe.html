                            This pesto, egg and potato skillet is a flavorful meal made with just five ingredients
                            thanks to a generous spoonful of pesto, which adds an herby richness. The eggs can easily be
                            cooked to your liking. If you prefer the yolks cooked through, add a few extra minutes to
                            the cook time in Step 3. Garnish with basil, if desired.

                            These high-protein peanut butter baked oats with jelly are a delicious mash-up that combines
                            the nostalgic flavors of peanut butter and jelly with the hearty texture of baked oats.
                            Packed with protein from peanut butter, Greek-style yogurt and eggs, these baked oats will
                            help keep you full and energized throughout the morning.

                            Chopping the veggies and smoked salmon together with the cream cheese allows for an even
                            distribution of ingredients, ensuring the perfect bite every time. We like the flavor and
                            fiber that a whole-grain everything bagel adds, but any kind of bagel works well here. For a
                            fun twist, use a flavored cream cheese.

                            This creamy raspberry-peach chia seed smoothie is the best way to start your day or recharge
                            in the afternoon. Chia seeds add fiber to keep you full and satisfied. The natural sweetness
                            of frozen peaches combined with dates and the tangy brightness of raspberries make every sip
                            refreshing and satisfying.

                            high-protein meal. This bowl will keep you going strong throughout the morning, while an egg
                            adds richness and even more staying power. Pulled together in only 20 minutes, this
                            breakfast is the perfect choice for starting your day off right.

                            This quick egg scramble with hearty bread is one of the best breakfasts for weight loss. It
                            combines protein-packed eggs and superfood raspberries with filling whole-grain toast and
                            nutrient-rich spinach. The protein and fiber help fill you up and keep you going through the
                            morning.

                        <h3>Orange Peel Smoothie</h3>
                        <img class="screenshot" src="../image/Screenshot_252.png" alt="Pesto, Egg, & Potato Skillet" />
                        <p>
                            This creamy smoothie makes the most of the entire orange—peel and all. In addition to
                            cutting down on food waste, studies suggest that orange peel is a powerhouse for gut health,
                            packed with fiber to nourish beneficial gut bacteria. If you’re going to include orange peel
                            in your recipes more often, consider using organic oranges and giving them a thorough
                            cleaning before using. We recommend fresh ginger for the best flavor here, but you can
                            substitute ¼ teaspoon ground ginger in its place if you prefer.

                        <p>
                            This dairy-free gut-healthy smoothie features kiwi (a prebiotic) and coconut-milk yogurt (a
                            probiotic) working together to support a healthy gut. Golden kiwis add a lovely golden hue
                            to the smoothie, but green kiwis work just as well.
