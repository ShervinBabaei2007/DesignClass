                            Edamame are young soybeans, generally found in the grocery store's frozen section. They

                            Lentils provide a great high-protein base for a savory breakfast plate. One cup of cooked

                        <p>
                            We've replaced chicken with shrimp in this delicious and easy spin on the classic Cobb
                            salad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This satisfying salad takes just about 20 minutes to make, so it's perfect for weeknight
                            dinners, but it's elegant enough to serve to guests.

                        <p>
                            A savory marinade made with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil adds rich flavor to
                            tender sirloin steak pieces in this healthy beef-and-broccoli stir-fry. The fresh aromatics
                            give the meat a warm, balanced taste, while the sesame oil adds a nutty finish. As the steak
                            cooks, the marinade helps keep each bite juicy and full of flavor without needing extra
                            salt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We recommend partially freezing the beef before slicing, because it firms up the meat and
                            makes it easier to cut into thin, even strips. This allows the steak to cook quickly and
                            pair well with crisp broccoli. Served over brown rice or whole-grain noodles, this dish
                            creates a balanced meal that delivers protein, fiber, and important nutrients in every bite.

                        <img src="/image2/GingerTahiniSalmon.png" alt="Ginger-Tahini Oven-Baked Salmon & Vegetables" />
                        <p>
                            The tahini sauce does double duty in this healthy salmon recipe, serving as a glaze for the
                            fish and also as a drizzle for the entire dish at the end of cooking. The green beans are
                            cooked just slightly in this recipe, to still be crisp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you like your green beans tenderer, look for thinner beans or haricot verts in the
                            grocery store; they'll cook more quickly. This sheet-pan dinner recipe is not only
                            delicious--it also comes together with just 25 minutes of active prep time, and there's only
                            one pan to clean up afterwards!

                        <p>
                            Skip the tortillas in favor of this warm fajita salad, which features a nutritious medley of
                            chicken with roasted kale, bell peppers and black beans
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The chicken, beans and vegetables are all cooked on the same pan, so this healthy dinner is
                            easy to make and the cleanup is easy too.

                        <p>
                            This chicken Parmesan soup combines the rich flavors of a traditional chicken Parm—juicy
                            seasoned chicken, tangy marinara sauce and savory Parmesan cheese—with the warmth and
                            comfort of a soup.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s a perfect dish for those chilly days when you crave something familiar with a fun,
                            innovative twist! We love the punchy burst of flavor that Parmesan crisps offer as a
                            garnish, but feel free to add freshly grated Parmesan in their place.
